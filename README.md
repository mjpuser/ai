## Retina Cells
### Rods and Cones
The retina is the outermost layer of neurons that are going to be accepting input.  It will mimic the behavior of human vision: 3 types of cones (R, B, G) and rods.  Rods are more sensitive to light than cones (by 100 fold) but have a lower resolution since there is convergence to bipolar cells (there are many rods to one bipolar cell).  Cones have a 1 to 1 to 1 relationship with cones -> bipolar cells -> ganglion cells.  There is also a high density cones in the center of the retina vs the periphery.  This is for focus on a single than rather than everything. Rods are more densely populated on the periphery, though, however they have less resolution as stated above.  Photo receptors are inhibited when they sense light, and are depolarized in the dark.

### Bipolar Cells and Horizontal Cells
Bipolar cells relay cone and rod stimuli, and offer a graded potential to horizontal cells.  


### Ganglion Cells
Ganglion cells have on-center and off-center receptive fields.  When a light reaches an on-center ganglion cell, it will inhibit the rods and cones in the surround area.  In an off-center horizontal cell, it will inhibit the photoreceptors in the surrounding area when there is darkness in the middle.  Ganglion cells then relay to the thalamus.
