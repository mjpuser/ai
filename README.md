## Retina Cells
The human retina contains about 120 million rod cells and 6 million cone cells. The number and ratio of rods to cones varies among species, dependent on whether an animal is primarily diurnal or nocturnal. Certain owls, such as the tawny owl,[6] have a tremendous number of rods in their retinae. In addition, there are about 2.4 million to 3 million ganglion cells in the human visual system, the axons of these cells form the 2 optic nerves, 1 to 2% of them photosensitive.

### Rods and Cones
The retina is the outermost layer of neurons that are going to be accepting input.  It will mimic the behavior of human vision: 3 types of cones (R, B, G) and rods.  Rods are more sensitive to light than cones (by 100 fold) but have a lower resolution since there is convergence to bipolar cells (there are many rods to one bipolar cell).  Cones have a 1 to 1 to 1 relationship with cones -> bipolar cells -> ganglion cells.  There is also a high density cones in the center of the retina vs the periphery.  This is for focus on a single than rather than everything. Rods are more densely populated on the periphery, though, however they have less resolution as stated above.  Photo receptors are inhibited when they sense light, and are depolarized in the dark.

### Bipolar Cells and Horizontal Cells
Bipolar cells relay cone and rod stimuli, and offer a graded potential to horizontal cells.  


### Ganglion Cells
Ganglion cells have on-center and off-center receptive fields.  When a light reaches an on-center ganglion cell, it will inhibit the rods and cones in the surround area.  In an off-center horizontal cell, it will inhibit the photoreceptors in the surrounding area when there is darkness in the middle.  Ganglion cells then relay to the thalamus.

There are two types of ganglion cells, transient and sustained.  Transient ganglion cells will fire rapidly on first excitement, and go back to resting.  Sustained have a smaller initial jump, and stronger idle firing rate.
